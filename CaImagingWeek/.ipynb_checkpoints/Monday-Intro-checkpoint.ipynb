    "### What is calcium imaging?\n",
    "you ask? Great question! Calcium imaging allows you to actually *watch* specific neurons firing away in a live, behaving animal (well, usually mouse. but not always!). This is great, because humans, as experimentors, are very visual animals (did you know over half of our brain is devoted to vision), so we like to be able to \"see\" what we're measuring.\n"
