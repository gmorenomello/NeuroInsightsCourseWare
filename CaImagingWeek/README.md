# Week 4: Calcium Imaging
Welcome to Week 4 of the NeuroInsights course! 
<br> <br>
This week we will discuss **calcium imaging**, a technique that has swept through labs around the world in the past decades and allowed scientists to truly "see" neurons firing.
<br> <br>
This week we will learn what kind of scientific questions you can answer with calcium imaging and how to handle calcium imaging data. We will condense into one week the whole lifecycle of an experiment, from conception to paper figures. <br> <br> Pitstops will include 
+ the basic physics and biochemistry behind calcium imaging
+ raw data file formats
+ preprocessing steps and data cleaning
+ data visualization and 
+ population analysis.
