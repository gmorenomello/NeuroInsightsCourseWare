    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from your laboratory skills and domain specific knowledge, much of your success in science can be attributed to your ability to understand, process and extract value from data. Data science is a collection of knowledge, practices and tools that allow you to handle data in a domain agnostic way. This means that in data science perspective, where the data comes from is irrelevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach establishes a set of common practices and vocabularies across different fields of expertise. Which is good for exchange of experiences and methodologies.  In this way, for example, a method developed for epidemiological analysis can be quickly understood and used by economists to understand the effect of fake news.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course offers an overview and introduction to many of the analysis and methods available. And we are going to make an effort to show the most frequently used analysis in different subfields of neuroscience. But because there is no time to explore every single one of them, it is up to you to identify what methods best serve your purpose and use it as a starting point to take your research further. This means that it is YOUR responsibility to relate the techniques, practices and tools presented here to your specific field of expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are assuming that you have fundamental knowledge in neuroscience and scientific methodologies. Because of that, we are going to introduce some concepts in neuroscience to contextualize the data and the analysis methods. But do not expect that we spend much time discussing details of neuroscientific studies or experimental design. **For that, the students enrolled in the 10 ECTS version of the course will have X weeks to study and discuss how apply the techniques to their research.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose python because it is easy to learn, free and offers many out-of-the-shelf libraries to make our lives easy. But The concepts here are easily transferable to Matlab, R and other languages. We are going to provide a basic code that you can use as a template to explore analysing other data, and give you time to play with some of the parameters. And although we do not have the time to explore how to adapt the code to your data in class, because that would consume an enourmous amount of time, we encourage you to do it by yourself. We are not assuming that you know python but we assume that you have basic programming skills to be able to catch up with python's syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not assume that you have a background handling data or performing analysis. So we are going to review some concepts in math and statistics as they are necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that this is the first edition of the course, so although we put much effort into covering the main topics as thoroughly as possible, there are certainly some blindspots and we count on your active participation to improve the course as we go. Also, how far we can get in the program is unpredictable. You come from different backgrounds and that makes planning more difficult. If we manage to get through the whole program, we have prepared extra problems and we can tackle them through exercises. If not, then you are invited to come next year for a more in depth course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of the course is to give you the fundamental tools to build your own data analysis pipeline. This pipeline starts at the end of your experiment when the raw data is acquired locally to the moment it becomes a publishable figure in a paper or poster.\n",

    "## Course Overview\n",
    "As a scientist, you are involved in the recording of the data. Recording data often means writing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), interacting with hardware, and understanding the computing machine itself, understands how the data are gathered, the tools used for gathering, how they are stored, how the pipeline is built and maintained, how they are visualized, how humans interact with the data/product, and how each decision about the overall flow of the data impacts the research. In this course we are going to assume that you collected the data, the challenge is to extract meaning from it.\n",

    "In this course you are going to learn:\n",
    "- Python programming, version control and good coding strategies\n",
    "- What are the different Data Types and Data structures, including event, time-series and image data, and how they affect your data analysis strategies.\n",
    "- How to to use python open and read data from multiple file formats\n",
    "- How to preprocess your data. Which involves Cleaning, Filtering, Dealing with missing values, Aligning, Normalizing, and Standardizing your data and data structure so it is ready for analysis.\n",
    "- How to organize your data set so it is ready for inspection and publication\n",
    "- What are models and why they matter\n",

    "## What is data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Science** can be thought as a field of study that pursuits to *understand and to explain the structure of data*, to make *predictions* from this understanding using any means necessary, mostly by *using algorithms and principles from computer science, statistics and machine learning*. In other words, it aims at transforming observations into insights, predictions and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every science uses data to get insight about the phenomenon it wants to understand. So, what is special about Data Science? The difference, between data science and other sciences, is that in data science, the data themselves take the center stage and become the subject of study. This means that within an explicitly data-centric framework, the source of the data does not matter much. What matters is the kind or type of the data.  It is the characteristic that will impose most of the contraints on how we are going to use the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Little addendum, Notice that I use data in the plural, the singular of data is datum*\n",
    "\n",
    "Offcourse, in real life you have to apply your domain knowledge to analyse the data. Hence, the choise of your data analysis methods is highly dependent on three things: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the question\n",
    "- the data types \n",
    "- how the data were obtained\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in **Scientific Research** are obtained through laborous experiments for particular purposes. Generally to rule out alternative hypothesis, to measure effects, or to describe patterns or relationships. This implies that, in most of the times, neuroscientific studies rely on a basic common toolkit of methods. Thus, by exploring **common questions** and **comon data types** that are relevant in neurosciences, one can learn not only the most often used data methods, but also learn when they are suitable."

    "## From observations to measures to metrics to statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract insight from nature we need to make sense of our **observations**. In science, we observe different phenomenas and we can describe them in many different ways, including long text reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, ideally we want to describe observations in a way that is economical, as objective as possible and in a way that allows us to compare multiple observations. So we can conclude something from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the advantage of Quantitative methods. We attribute values to magnitudes of our observations and use them as **measures** of our observation. Generally in neurosciences we do not have direct access to what information the brain is processing, so we use measures of observable variables as **metrics** (standardized quatifiable representations) of underlying, less observable phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classical examples are Attention Load and Learning. Just by looking at someone it is hard to tell if they are paying attention or learning something. To do so, we have to put the participant or subject under a situation where it becomes possible to measure through their behavior the attention or learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Neurosciences, we want to infer something about how the brain works and implements behaviors by measuring observable phenomenas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the course, we are going to explore multiple ways of encoding observation into quantities and doing several operations on them to describe, sumarize, and compare them, as well as generate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### VARIABLE TYPES\n",
    "A variable is any charactersitic, number or quantity that can be measured or counted.\n",
    "example: Age, Gender, Income, Eye colour, gene.\n",
    "Variables can be numerical or categorical\n",
    "Numerical and categorical variable scan be divided even further.\n",
    "Numerical can be discrete or continuous.\n",
    "Categorical can be Nominal, Ordinal or Temporal (Data/time)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical Type\n",
    "Discrete variables are whole numbers (counts). Ex.: number of objects, animals, presses.\n",
    "Continuous variables are values that can contain any value within a range is called continous. Ex: amount of eaten food, latency, weight.\n",
    "Binary can only assume two values. Usually reflecting the belonging to a class (0 or 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Type\n",
    "The values are selected from a group of categories or labels.\n",
    "Ordinal are categories that can be meaningully ordered. Position\n",
    "Nominal variables. There is no intrinsic order.\n",
    "Some times the categories are represented with numbers. Ex. 0 female, 1 male. But that doest mean that the number has intrinsic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Date and Time Types\n",
    "**Date and Time variables**\n",
    "Date and time can contain only date, only time or date and time information. They are often used as metadata.\n",
    "This is a special data format that requires proper pre-processing to enrich the dataset dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mixed Types\n",
    "Are variables that contains categorical and numerical values embedded into them. They are usually represented as strings and need to be parsed (broken down into several variables) to be properly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Characteristics**\n",
    "How the variable characteristics impact your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Data\n",
    "Missing data or missing values occur when no data is stored for a certain oservation in a variable.\n",
    "Missing data are common occurrence in most datasets\n",
    "Missing data can have significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawm from the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing data causes** A value is missing because it was forgotten, lost or not stored properly. If the value of the variable do not exist (for example dividing by 0), not found or not identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many libraries do not support missing data so a decision must be made if the observation will be ignored or if a data imputation technique will be employed.\n",
    "Missing data imputation affect your models and the insights that you can take from them So you will have to have that into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing data Mechanisms** understanding the missing data mechanisms may help us to choos the right missing data imputation technique. \n",
    "- **MCAR** - Missing data completely at random: when the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. There is no relationship between the data missing and any other values observed or missing within the dataset. Thus, disregardign those cases would not bias the inferences made. \n",
    "- **MAR** - Missing data at random: The probability of missing an observation depends on available information. For instance, if it is more likely to have missing data from female participants than male ones. This might be a good idea to include the independent variable as a control to balance the missing points.\n",
    "- **MNAR** - Missing data not at random: There is a mechanism or a reason why missing values are introduced in the dataset. For instance, if people do not reply to the depression survey because they are depressed. In this situation it could be useful to flag these observations, because they allow to predict the outcome. The missing values are predictive of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set and Collections\n",
    "Sets are collections of objects or values. Usually denoted by upper case letters $S$\n",
    "Objects within a set are called elements or members of a sets. They are usually denominated by lower case letters, like $x$. And the format $x \\in S $ is used express that the element $x$ belongs to the set S.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S = \\{x | is an odd, positive number lower than 50\\}$\n",
    "$ S = \\{x: is an odd\\}$\n",
    "Two sets are equal if they have the same elements, disregarding order and repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cardinality\n",
    "The cardinality of a set $ S $ is the number of distinct(unique) elements in the set. Which is notation is $ |S|$. Thus if $ A = \\{1,2,3,2\\} $, the cardinality of A will be $|A| = 3 $. The same applies for categorical sets where $G = \\{male, female, male, male, female, female, female\\}$ the cardinality will be  $|G| = 2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of a categorical variable are selected from a group of categories or labels\n",
    "The number of different labels/categories is known as cardinality.\n",
    "**Cardinality effects** many libraries and models do not operate on strings. This means that it is necessary to convert categories into numbers to operate them in mathematical models. Categorical encoding techniques must be applied. One example of such techiniques is one-hot encoding. and it is used in several methods to build something called a design matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "High cardinality might also lead to uneven distribution between train and test sets, because some categories might fall only in one of the sets. Leading to over-fitting in tree based algorithms and operational problems.\n",
    "Variables with too many labels tend to dominate over those with fewer labels, particularly in tree based algorightms.\n",
    "A big number of lables within a variable may introduce noise.\n",
    "Reducing cardinality may help to improve model performance.\n",
    "- strings(categories) need to be encoded as numbers to be used in models\n",
    "- high cardinality may cause several over-fitting and operationalisation problems\n",
    "- Reducing cardinality may hel to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rare labels** are more likely to be found in high cardinality sets. They cause the same effects of high cardinality. As they introduce noise in the data. One must consider if rare labels should be combined in a meaningful super category or discarted from the dataset.\n",
    "- Quantify the frequency of different categories.\n",
    "- Examples of uneven distributions between train and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Model Assumptions\n",
    "Linear models make the following assumptions about the independent variable (X)\n",
    "- **Linear relationship** between the variables and the target: $ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n$. Where $\\beta_0$ is the bias or intercept, and the other betas represent the slope. And the other Linear relationship can be assessed with scatter plots. Sometimes non-linear transformations of the variables and the target improve the linear relationship.\n",
    "- Multivariate normality: This happens where every independent variable follows the Gaussian distribution. Normality can be assessed with **histograms** and **Q-Q plots**. Normality can be statistically tested, for example with **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** test. When the variable is not normally distributed a non-linear transformation (e.g., logarithmic transformation) may fix the issue. \n",
    "- No or little co-linearity: Multicolinearity occurs when the independent variables are correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can be assessed with a correlation matrix or the variance inflation factor (VIF).\n",
    "    - Outside of the scope of this course\n",
    "    - Feature selection.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: It is alwo known as homogeneity of variance, hapens when the independent variable shave the same finite variance. There are tests and plots to determine homoscedasticity.\n",
    "    - Residual plot\n",
    "    - Levene's test\n",
    "    - Barlett's test\n",
    "    - Goldfeld-Quandt test\n",
    "    - Non-linear transformations and feature scaling can help improve homogeneity of variance.\n",

    "### Variable / Probability Distributions\n",
    "A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a variable can take.\n",
    "- probabilities  distributions indicate the likelihood of an event or outcome.\n",
    "- p(x) = the likelihood that random variable takes a specific value of x.\n",

    "\n",
    "A good convention should have in mind scripts and applications so that automation is easier to implement. For instance, if the naming has the days of the weak, it is better to just use the three first letters than the whole day name, which varies in size.\n",

    "1. **Data Source Raw** - should be stored somewhere, preferentially in a hard drive in a different physical location. The harddrive should be properly labeled. Look at file title formatting for references. And add a number to tell the order in which the drives were added to the pool. If you do copies of the same hard-drive, use letters A, B, C for versions.\n",
    "2. Raw Data Backup: As soon as possible, and if resources are available you should backup the data. The backup is what you use to perform analysis. Never open the original raw data as many softwared change the file when they open it, and there is no way to know it before it is too late. \n",

    "Classical conditioning is induced by the simultaneous presentation of a neutral odor cue (conditioned stimulus, CS⁺) and a reinforcement stimulus, e.g., an electric shock or sucrose, (unconditioned stimulus, US), that become associated with one another by the animal1,16. A second conditioned stimulus (CS⁻) is subsequently presented without the US. During the testing phase, Drosophila are simultaneously presented with CS+ and CS- odors. After the Drosophila are provided time to choose between the odors, the distribution of the animals is recorded. This procedure allows associative aversive or appetitive conditioning to be reliably measured without a bias introduced by the innate preference for either of the conditioned stimuli. Various control experiments are also performed to test whether all genotypes respond normally to odor and reinforcement alone.\n",
