    "## 4.1 Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Values are just direct representations of observations. Values are used to measure an observation quantitatively(**with a number**) or to classify the observation qualitatively (**with a label**). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, values come in different types (**data type**). The data type (or value type) establish mainly 4 things:\n",
    "1. How much memory your computer will set appart to store the value in it.\n",
    "2. The resolution of your measure.\n",
    "3. The operators and functions that can work on this values. In other words, how you transform and manipulate the values.\n",
    "4. A set of standard tools avaliable to operate with the value.\n",
    "Do not worry to much if you do not understand it, all is going to become clear soon. For now, let's deal with the most basic values. Essentially you have three main value types: \n",
    "- Numeric, \n",
    "- String,\n",
    "- Boolean.\n",
    "Different value types are more suitable for different applications. For instance, numeric is better for observations like age, income or reaction time; Strings are better to describe things like personality type, genetic line, clinical condition or any kind of label; and Booleans are better to binary classifications like male/female, experimental/control, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you are going to learn how to build your on data type. But lets focus on the basic ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric can be divided in:\n",
    "- Integer - whole numbers\n",
    "- Float - with decimal points\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical can be divided in:\n",
    "- Strings: a collection of alphanumeric symbols (characters)\n",
    "- Boolean: Binary logic statements or truth - False or True; 0 or otherwise."

Also, the mathematical operation for equality = in python is represented by ==. We are going to discuss the equality operator later.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assing many values to many variable names simultaneously.\n",

    "4. You should use underscore to connect words.(bad: reactionTime, good: reaction_time)\n",

    "Good variable naming is often ignored. As you your softwares become bigger and more complex, the importance of good variable naming will become critical. When variables can be used instantaneously, in the next couple of lines of code, or used by distant parts of your code, in different files. We call this **the scope** of the variable. The wider the scope, the longer and more descriptive should be the variable's name.\n",

    "## 4.7 Loops\n",
    "Loops are blocks of code that are executed many times over. Loops are useful when you have to **repeat a set of operations** for different data, files or values in a collection. Each one of these repetitions is called an **Iteration**, and loops can be combined with control flows to change its behavior from one iteration to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are also useful in automation when your software is repating measurements many times over or waiting for a particular event or input to happen so the software can respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially two kinds of loops in Python. They are the **while**  and the **for** loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7.1 While Loops\n",
    "While loops can be understood as a special kind of **if statement**. While a given condition (test of a value) is **True** the block of code will be executed again and again. \n",
    "\n",
    "While loops usually depend on a variable that controls if the block of code will continue to be executed or not. Typically, this is a variable that is updated within the loop's block of code until it reaches a target value. The flowchart below makes it more clear.\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"usr/while_loop_flowchart.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",

    "In the example above, the while loop is dependent on the variable **count**. While the assertion **count <= 10** is **True** the block of code the prints count and adds one to count will be repeated. Once the assertion is evaluated **False**, meaning that count is bigger than 10, the word \"end\" will be printed and the code will end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python the code above is expressed in the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0 # control variable initialization\n",
    "while count <= 10: # condition\n",
    "    print(count)\n",

    "print(\"end\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Infinite loop trap\n",
    "It is important to be be aware that if the while loop condition is never evaluated as False, the software will be stuck in an infinite loop. This is normally an error that must to be avoided, and to stop the software it is necessary to press ``CMD + C`` or ``Ctrl + C``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infine loops happens because the control variable are wrongly updated or the condition is not well set, so it never evaluates false.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nested loops\n",
    "One loop can be stated inside of the other. Putting a block of code inside of other block of code is called **nesting**. Nested loops are usefull when you need to repeat instructions in cycles. Like one instruction for every hour of the day in every day of the week.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "day = 1\n",
    "while day <= 7:\n",

    "For instance, to analyze the data in all the rows, in all the collumns in a table. The outer loop would be the rows and the inner loop will be the collumns. \n",

For one iteration the block of code can use the temporary variable to do operations on the current element of the collection. \n",

    "To use functions or procedures, it is first necessary to **define** the block of code of the function and associate it with a name. This is done with the command **def** followed by the name one wants to give to the function and parenthesis and collons **():**. Collons define the start of a block of code. The parenthesis will be explained later.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4.8.1 Parameters and Arguments\n",
    "The first example is not very striking because the block of code is always doing the same thing. To enable more complex behaviors, it is possible to pass values from outside of the procedure to inside. This is done through parameters.\n",

    "#### 4.8.3 Recursion\n",
    "**Recursion** is a mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself from within. Recursion is a way to loop through data to reach a result without using **while** or **for** loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "When written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming. But one must be aware that recursion might incur in the **infinite loop trap** or it may become a **memory hog**. However, \n",
    "\n",
    "To work properly. Recursions must define a **standard state** and an **end state**. This means that almost all recursions will have a nested if-statement. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(number):\n",
    "    if number == 1: # End case. The factorial of 1 is one.\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    return number * factorial(number-1) #Standard case\n",
    "\n",
    "factorial(5) # output 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, factorial() is a function that we have defined to call itself (\"recurse\"). We use the **number** variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the end condition is satisfied (number is equal to 1).\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4.10 OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)\n",
    "Object oriented programming is a way of organizing the code into entities called **object** that allows the code to be scalable, maintainable and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP leverage the intuition that in real life we accomplish tasks by using objects. For instance, people (an object) use a hammer, nail and wood (different set of objects) to build a boat (a complex object). OOP tries to do the same by creating software analogies to real objects to get the job done. In real life, every object have some information (characteristic, knowledge, attribute) and some behavior (it can do something or be affected in some way). These characteristics can be thought data or variables, in OOP called as **Attributes**. And these behaviors can be implemented as functions of the object, in OOP called as **Methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects** in OOP can be understood as the next step in abstraction beyond functions. While functions associate a block of code (usually a set of instructions) to a name to be called at any time. Objects encapsulate not only instructions, but also **methods**(functions inside objects) and **attributes/fields/properties**(variables inside objects). This sort of encapsulation creates an hierarchical data structure that packs data together with the operations that are often used to manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You aready used objects before. A simple example are Strings. Strings have attributes (an ordered collection of characters) and methods (.split, .join). The text data and the method are both packed under the same object name.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### 4.10.1 CLASS\n",
    "To create an object, it is necessary first to create a **class**. A class is a template of a blueprint to create objects. In the same way that to use a function, the function must be first declared once and then it can be  called anywhere, the design of objects must be first defined in a class. Classes are defined with the **class** keyword followed by the class name (class names are capitalized to distinguish from function names).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The code below defines an empty class.\n",
    "class Mouse:\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "The class above doesn't have any attribute or method. But it can be **instantiated**, meaning that it can be used to create objects from it. Objects are instantiated by calling the class name followed by parantheses. The call must be assigned to a variable that will make reference to the object.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.10.1.1 Attributes\n",
    "We can add add attributes to the class so the objects can do more interresting things.\n",

    "    name = None    # attribute 1\n",
    "    data = list()  # attribute 2\n",

    "print(mouse_2.name) # output None\n",

    "\n",
    "Constructor method is a standard method in a class that is the first one to run when the class is instantiated. It is used to pass values to the object at creation, as well as activating other standard methods as necessary. In python, the constructor method is __init__().\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.10.1.3 The instance reference parameter \"self\"\n",
    "Note the parameter **self**. Self is a reference to the current instance of the class (the object), and it is used to access variables that belongs to the object. It does not have to be named **self**, you can call it whatever you like, but it is the first parameter of all methods of any class. **self** and **obj** are the most conventional names.\n",
