    "### What is GIT\n",
    "### Install GIT\n",
    "**GitHub for Windows**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Configure\n",
    "GIT can store information about the user in three places. Global, User, and Project. To configure user's information for all local repositories `git config --global user.name \"[name]\"`. This sets the name you want attached to all your commit transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global user.email \"[email address]\"` Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global color.ui auto` Enables helpful colorization of command line output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a standard editor, you type `git config --global core.editor [editor call]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also retrieve the configuration information by typing `git config [configuration field]` for instance `git config user.name` will return the user defined in the configuraiton. To view all the configurations you type `git config --list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VIM & NANO\n",
    "`vi [file name`, by typing i it enters in edit mode. ESC to exit editing. press column **:**  to receive new commands and type **w** for write and **q** for exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Repositories\n",
    "You can start a new repository or obtain one from an existing URL. To creates a new local repository in your local drive with a specified name, you must first create a new directory/folder, go inside it and type:  `git init [project-name]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a local repository, git will create a folder `.git` which contains informations about the configurations, the branches, the history, hooks (which are triggers to do some actions), etc. It will track the changes that will happen inside the folder where your repository is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have an online repository you can type: `git clone [url]`. This will download the project and its entire version history to your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File life cycle\n",
    "- **untracked** when the file was inserted into the folder but it is not yet tracked by git. It doesn't belongs to the repository yet.\n",
    "- **unmodified**  you can add a file to the repository. From this moment onwards git will track the changes in the file. The file is considered unmodified because it exists in the repository, but no changes were tracked.\n",
    "- **modified** when you edit the file, not the file is marked as modified.\n",
    "- **staged** is the space in memory to prepare the version. All files added to the stage will belong to the changes in a particular version. You use `git add [filename -A]` to stage a file to a new version.\n",
    "- **commiting** when you commit the version `git commit -m \"message\"` all the modifications done in the files that were staged will be implemented to the new version. So the application goes back to **unmodified** stage for a new version.\n",

    "### Tracking and Making Changes\n",
    "As you are going to see, the different versions in GIT are represented in a Tree like structure. Each new version is a new point in this tree so it becomes bigger the more versions you have. You can also create a **branch**, or a parallel and independent series of versions that share a common ancestral version. This is useful to try different ideas or to keep the production code stable while different teams work on different parts of the system. Later, these branches can also **merge**, so you can incorporate the changes of different branches to one main code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the tree grows up, the tip of the tree, or the last committed version in the current working branch is called the **HEAD**. You can think of the HEAD as the \"current branch\". Later we are going to discuss how to use branches and merges. For now we are going to assume that you only have one branch and wants to keep track of the versions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you need to be able to track the files in your repository and know their status regarding the lifecycle. To do that you use: `git status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this better, lets create a file and move it through different stages of its life cycle. If you create a new file in the folder and type `git status` you will see the file listed as untracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stage that file so it is tracked by GIT and make part of a new version, type\n",
    "`git add [file]` this will set the file as a **new file** in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you modify the file and type `git status`. You are going to notice that the file is labeled as modified. If you want to keep these changes in the new version, you must stage the file again through the command `git add [file]` .\n",
    "\n",
    "To lists all new or modified files in the stage to be committed, type.\n",
    "`git diff`. This will snapshot the file in preparation for versioning. To show the differences between the current edits and the previous version, you must type `git diff --staged`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because you might need to remove a change that you stages. You can unstage a file by typing: \n",
    "`git reset [file]`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the new version and save the changes, you must use the commit command: `git commit -m \"[descriptiv message]\"`. The commit allows you to have an associated message that allows you to know and keep track of the changes you made. The commited version will be include only the changes that were staged. A tip for the message is to tell what you have done, starting with a verb in the imperative voice. Finally, you can combine staging with commiting by typing `git commit -am \"[descriptiv message]\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each commit has a specific number that identifies that particular commit in the history of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review History\n",
    "The point of any version control is to be able to track the different versions and know how what changes happened and when. To browse and inspect the evolution of the project files, you can use  `git log`. Which will list all the different commits in the repository with their unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use `git log --decorate`to get some extra informations like merging and branching.\n",
    "Lists version history for the current branch. You can also track all the changes made by one author by typing `git log --author \"[authorname]\"`. Alternativelly you can have a summary with `git shortlog`, which will give you a list of authors, how many commits they did and what changes they introduced.`git shortlog -sn`gives you the list of authors and how many commits they did. To have a visual representation of the branches type `git log --graph`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the reference number of the commit you can get more information about the particular version. To view the metadata and content changes of the specified commit, type:  `git show [commit reference]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you can list version history for a file, including all the renaming it may have suffered: `git log --follow [file]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To review the changes you implemented. use `git diff`. It will show beside a **+** all the things you added and beside a **-** all the things you removed. If you only want to see which files were modified you type `git diff --name-only`. This is especially usefull if there are many small modifications in multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diff also allows you to shows content differences between two branches\n",
    "`git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you modify a file, and you did not stage it yet and want to undo all the changes you have made. You can can just type `git checkout [filename]\"` and the last version will be restored. You can unstage a file by typing: \n",
    "`git reset [file]`. The command reset is especially useful because it can operate after the *commit*. Essentially you can use in three different ways after the commit:\n",
    "- `git reset --soft [commit reference]` It will undo the commit, but all the modified files will be staged.\n",
    "- `git reset --mixed [commit reference]` It will undo the commit, preserve the modified files but before staging.\n",
    "- `git reset --hard [commit reference]` It will completely ignore the changes between the last commit and the previous one. So the previous version will be restored.\n",
    "Be careful because the reset command affects the history of your repository.\n",
