    "## Version control and GIT\n",
    "### What is Version Control and why do you need it\n",
    "Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is one of the many softwares available for version control. Git is native in Linux and MacOSX and can be installed in windows. Many version control softwares save incremental changes (differences). GIT, on the other hand takes a snapshot (state) of all the files in the repository at the moment that a version is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install GIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Download from https://git-scm.com/download\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure\n",
    "GIT can store information about the user in three places. Global, User, and Project. To configure user's information for all local repositories `git config --global user.name \"[name]\"`. This sets the name you want attached to all your commit transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global user.email \"[email address]\"` Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global color.ui auto` Enables helpful colorization of command line output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a standard editor, you type `git config --global core.editor [editor call]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also retrieve the configuration information by typing `git config [configuration field]` for instance `git config user.name` will return the user defined in the configuraiton. To view all the configurations you type `git config --list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VIM & NANO\n",
    "`vi [file name`, by typing i it enters in edit mode. ESC to exit editing. press column **:**  to receive new commands and type **w** for write and **q** for exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Repositories\n",
    "You can start a new repository or obtain one from an existing URL. To creates a new local repository in your local drive with a specified name, you must first create a new directory/folder, go inside it and type:  `git init [project-name]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a local repository, git will create a folder `.git` which contains informations about the configurations, the branches, the history, hooks (which are triggers to do some actions), etc. It will track the changes that will happen inside the folder where your repository is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have an online repository you can type: `git clone [url]`. This will download the project and its entire version history to your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File life cycle\n",
    "- **untracked** when the file was inserted into the folder but it is not yet tracked by git. It doesn't belongs to the repository yet.\n",
    "- **unmodified**  you can add a file to the repository. From this moment onwards git will track the changes in the file. The file is considered unmodified because it exists in the repository, but no changes were tracked.\n",
    "- **modified** when you edit the file, not the file is marked as modified.\n",
    "- **staged** is the space in memory to prepare the version. All files added to the stage will belong to the changes in a particular version. You use `git add [filename -A]` to stage a file to a new version.\n",
    "- **commiting** when you commit the version `git commit -m \"message\"` all the modifications done in the files that were staged will be implemented to the new version. So the application goes back to **unmodified** stage for a new version.\n",

    "### Tracking and Making Changes\n",
    "As you are going to see, the different versions in GIT are represented in a Tree like structure. Each new version is a new point in this tree so it becomes bigger the more versions you have. You can also create a **branch**, or a parallel and independent series of versions that share a common ancestral version. This is useful to try different ideas or to keep the production code stable while different teams work on different parts of the system. Later, these branches can also **merge**, so you can incorporate the changes of different branches to one main code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the tree grows up, the tip of the tree, or the last committed version in the current working branch is called the **HEAD**. You can think of the HEAD as the \"current branch\". Later we are going to discuss how to use branches and merges. For now we are going to assume that you only have one branch and wants to keep track of the versions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you need to be able to track the files in your repository and know their status regarding the lifecycle. To do that you use: `git status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this better, lets create a file and move it through different stages of its life cycle. If you create a new file in the folder and type `git status` you will see the file listed as untracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stage that file so it is tracked by GIT and make part of a new version, type\n",
    "`git add [file]` this will set the file as a **new file** in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you modify the file and type `git status`. You are going to notice that the file is labeled as modified. If you want to keep these changes in the new version, you must stage the file again through the command `git add [file]` .\n",
    "\n",
    "To lists all new or modified files in the stage to be committed, type.\n",
    "`git diff`. This will snapshot the file in preparation for versioning. To show the differences between the current edits and the previous version, you must type `git diff --staged`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because you might need to remove a change that you stages. You can unstage a file by typing: \n",
    "`git reset [file]`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the new version and save the changes, you must use the commit command: `git commit -m \"[descriptiv message]\"`. The commit allows you to have an associated message that allows you to know and keep track of the changes you made. The commited version will be include only the changes that were staged. A tip for the message is to tell what you have done, starting with a verb in the imperative voice. Finally, you can combine staging with commiting by typing `git commit -am \"[descriptiv message]\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each commit has a specific number that identifies that particular commit in the history of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review History\n",
    "The point of any version control is to be able to track the different versions and know how what changes happened and when. To browse and inspect the evolution of the project files, you can use  `git log`. Which will list all the different commits in the repository with their unique identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use `git log --decorate`to get some extra informations like merging and branching.\n",
    "Lists version history for the current branch. You can also track all the changes made by one author by typing `git log --author \"[authorname]\"`. Alternativelly you can have a summary with `git shortlog`, which will give you a list of authors, how many commits they did and what changes they introduced.`git shortlog -sn`gives you the list of authors and how many commits they did. To have a visual representation of the branches type `git log --graph`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the reference number of the commit you can get more information about the particular version. To view the metadata and content changes of the specified commit, type:  `git show [commit reference]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you can list version history for a file, including all the renaming it may have suffered: `git log --follow [file]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To review the changes you implemented. use `git diff`. It will show beside a **+** all the things you added and beside a **-** all the things you removed. If you only want to see which files were modified you type `git diff --name-only`. This is especially usefull if there are many small modifications in multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diff also allows you to shows content differences between two branches\n",
    "`git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you modify a file, and you did not stage it yet and want to undo all the changes you have made. You can can just type `git checkout [filename]\"` and the last version will be restored. You can unstage a file by typing: \n",
    "`git reset [file]`. The command reset is especially useful because it can operate after the *commit*. Essentially you can use in three different ways after the commit:\n",
    "- `git reset --soft [commit reference]` It will undo the commit, but all the modified files will be staged.\n",
    "- `git reset --mixed [commit reference]` It will undo the commit, preserve the modified files but before staging.\n",
    "- `git reset --hard [commit reference]` It will completely ignore the changes between the last commit and the previous one. So the previous version will be restored.\n",
    "Be careful because the reset command affects the history of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remote Repository\n",
    "A **remote repository** in Git is a common repository used by all team members to exchange their updates. Often, the remote repository is stored on a On-Line hosting service like GitHub(https://github.com/) or BitBucket(https://bitbucket.org/product) or on a server within the institution's LAN (Local Area Network). In contrast to the **local repository**, the remote repository doesn't typically provide a file tree of the project's current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a remote repository you need to subscribe to one of the online services, we recommend github. Then you can start a new repository or a new organization. Repository is an individual repository that may have external contributors. An organization is a collective repository that allows you to manage different users (different roles with different rights), group them by teams, and have different projects. Organizations are good for labs, but not very good for single users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect github with SSH : https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh\n",
    "Github, Settings, SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synchronize repositories\n",
    "**git remote** shows the name of the remote repository.\n",
    "**git remote -v** shows extra information.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone \\[bookmark\\]` Copies all the entire remote repository to the local repository. It is very useful when you want/need to work on someone else's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternativelly, if you are working with organizations in github, you can fork the project. **Fork** will create a copy of the remote repository inside of your organization account (remotely) not in the local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch` is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original remote repository(it doesn't do any file transfering. It just checks to see if there are any changes available). `git pull` on the other hand does the same as `git fetch` and copies those changes from the remote repository. You can use `git fetch` to know the changes done in the remote repo/branch since your last **pull**. This is useful to allow for checking before doing an actual pull, which could change files in your current branch and working copy (and potentially losing your changes, etc). Example:\n",
    "`git fetch [bookmark]\n",
    " git diff ...origin`\n",
    "\n",
    "Uploads all commits in the local repository to the remote repository\n",
    "`git push [alias] [branch]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Changes\n",
    "A branch is a pointer that leads to the last commit of a series of commits. We can have multiple branches pointing to the same commit (the commit where two branches meet), or to different commits (two different commit series with a common anscestor branch). Branching offers many advantages such as:\n",
    "- You can modify the code without affecting the main branch (master)\n",
    "- You can connect and disconnect them very quickly.\n",
    "- Multiple users working at the same time\n",
    "- Prevents conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize all the branches names (series of commits) and identify the **HEAD** (current branch) you may use: `git branch`. Note that the name with a star \\* character is the HEAD branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch, you can type `git branch [branch-name]`. You are going to create a new branch that points to the last commit. But you did not change to that branch yet. To change the branch and start developing a parallel vesion, you need to type `git checkout [branch-name]`. You can also create a new branch and simultaneously make it the current branch by typing `git checkout -b [branch-name]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a branch it is very simple. Use `git branch -d [branch-name]`, but remember that you will need the reference code that appears next to the deleted branch's name, if you want to recover it. To remove a branch from the remote repository type `git push [repository name] :[branch-name]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MERGE** is the process of joining two branches together and collapsing both to the same series of commits. Merging combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch. To do so, the merge command creates an extra commit just to handle the joining of the changes within the branches.\n",
    "`git merge [branch]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**REBASE** is the process of moving one branch to the top of the other. In opposition to merge, that joins two branches in one meeting commit, rebase changes the base of one of the branches to the top of the current branch. In this way, there there is only one simplified commit series (one branch).\n",
    "`git rebase [branch]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**THUB RULE:** If you are working alone in a repository, which is used by others, create a *Developer's branch* and use **rebase** to update the changes to the *Master branch*. This will make easier to track your changes because you will have only one commit history. If you have multiple people working on independent parts of the code simultaneously, prefer to use **merge** because it makes clear who implemented each feature and when. Working on different files is prefered because merging two branches that changes the same file requires human supervision and it is very cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBSCURE GIT\n",
    "#### .gitignore\n",
    "This is a text file with the name **.gitignore** that contains a list of files or file extensions that you want your repository to ignore. This is useful to ignore data files or configuration files with passwords that you do not want to upload to the public repository. Example of content of **.gitignore** : `*.hdf5 *.cfg`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find a list of standard ignore files in **github/gitignore** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### git stash\n",
    "The command `git stash` allows you to get all the modified files in your working directory and store into a file to use lately. This is useful when you are working in some changes and are interrupted. By using `git stash` you can store all your modifications without affecting the commit or the staged files. Later, and at any point, you can use `git stash apply`to bring the modified files back to your working directory. `git stash list`shows a list of everything that is in your **stash**, and `git stash clear` erases the entire stash, but nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alias\n",
    "You can create shortcuts for your commands. By typing `git config --global alias.[shortcut] [command]` you can replace typing the command for the shortcut. Example: `git config --global alias.c checkout` means that to do checkouts, now you can simply type `git c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Versioning and Tags\n",
    "The best way to keep track of your released versions is by using **tags**. Tags allow you to add release version numbers and associate them to particular commits to the repository and add annotations. Here is the syntax:\n",
    "`git tag -a [version] -m \"[annotation]\"` .Example: `git tag -a 1.0.0 -m \"first version!!\"`. Then you have to push the tags to the remote repository with `git push origin master --tags`. The version will appear as a new release in the remote repository at github.\n",
    "\n",
    "To list all the tags you type `git tag`\n",
    "\n",
    "To erase branches locally you type `git tag -d [tag]`. To erase the tag in the remote repository, type `git push [repository name] :[tag]`. Example: `git push origin :1.0.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revert\n",
    "Revert creates a new commit with an older version of the code. In other words, it allows you to recover an older version of the code, and create a new commit of that at the top of your branch. Unlike checkout or reset, in which you lose all the commits after the recovery point, revert allows you to recover a \"working versions of your work\" without losing subsequent commits. The command `git revert [commit reference]` will create a new commit with the information revert.\n",
